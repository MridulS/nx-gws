    "# Speed up your NetworkX code with GraphBLAS\n",
    "\n",
    "NetworkX is a pure python library for graph theory and network science by design. The base data structure for graphs in NetworkX are python dictionaries. This comes with a lot of advantages like extremely flexible and abstract ways of modelling your graph data, but one of the shortcomings is the performance. Native python objects and looping over them can slow down some things. NetworkX does use the sparse.array module in SciPy wherever it can to speed up algorithms but this still requires moving data from NetworkX to SciPy which can be an expensive operation.\n",
    "\n",
    "With NetworkX 3.0 we have started experimenting with dispatching certain algorithms to GraphBLAS. GraphBLAS is a specification to do graph operations using tools in linear algebra. We are still in early stages of designing the API and dispatch mechanism to multiple different backends. This dispatch mechanism will also let users run code on different hardwares like GPUs. We hope to soon have a NetworkX backend which can link into CuGraph."
